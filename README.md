The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
*when we click on section link it will go the select section
the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
Build the navigation menu. This will dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page. This can be a particularly useful trick when you begin working with content management systems or APIs when you are uncertain of where the items will be.
